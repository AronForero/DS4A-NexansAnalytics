# Data Science 4 All - Nexans Project

Data Science project where Nexans data will be analysed, to highlight facts that could be useful for the company. Also the primary goal is to create a dashboard with that data, that allows the company to see the behaviour of their products, and costumers, and take actions based on that information.

The last step will be create a machine learning model to predict the sales behaviour, based on the company data and maybe some stocks data. The purpose of creating this model, is to make the company able to take decisions before big sales happen, preventing product shortages.
